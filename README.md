# animated-gifs
Huge collection of the animated gifs I use on http://tumblr.snipe.net and in my other Github issues/pull requests to make contributing more fun.

Yes, I know a few of them are not actually gifs. Quiet, you.

**Note: This repo is big. It has ~2.7k animated gifs, and they're all awesome, but it's big and it will take some time to download/clone.**

I'll be working on categorizing the ones that are not currently categorized over time, and renaming them all to something that actually means something. I need to do this for my own sanity (and so I can find the right gif when I need it), but it will take a little time to get everything categorized and appropriately named.

The copyrights to the actual images belong to their respective intellectual property copyright holders, blah blah blah. I have collected these over a period of years, so I couldn't tell you where I found most of them, and I'm reasonably certain the folks I nicked them from couldn't tell you where they originally found them either. Internet, amirite?

If you dig it and want to buy me a beer or a cup of coffee, you can do so with [Changetip](https://www.changetip.com/tipme/snipe). You don't have to, but it's always appreciated.

You're welcome to add to this repo, but understand that I'm very picky. If I don't accept your pull request because your gif isn't punchy enough, don't be sad. This isn't a collection of all gifs - this is a collection of gifs that I found to be particularly funny/biting/weird/useful. It's nothing personal.

There is no porn in this repo, although there may be hilarious depictions of sex toys or other things I find funny. Please don't submit a PR with porn. The internet has enough of that on its own, it doesn't need my help. 

Enjoy!
